# Painting-a-wall
Write a program to calculate the cost to paint a wall. Amount of required paint is based on the wall area. Total cost includes paint and sales tax.

Note: This program is designed for incremental development. Complete each step and submit for grading before starting the next step. Only a portion of tests pass after each step but confirm progress.

Step 1 (2 pts). Read from input wall height, wall width, and cost of one paint can (floats). Calculate and output the wall's area to one decimal place using print(f"Wall area: {wall_area:.1f} sq ft");. Submit for grading to confirm 1 test passes.

Step 2 (2 pts). Calculate and output the amount of paint needed to three decimal places. One gallon of paint covers 350 square feet. Submit for grading to confirm 2 tests pass.

Step 3 (2 pts). Calculate and output the number of 1 gallon cans needed to paint the wall. Extra paint may be left over. Hint: Use ceil() from the math module to round up to the nearest gallon (int). Submit for grading to confirm 4 tests pass.

Step 4 (4 pts). Calculate and output the paint cost, sales tax of 7%, and total cost. Dollar values are output with two decimal places. Submit for grading to confirm all tests pass.
